### ✅ Task 3: Fix test_briefing_generation

**File:** `src/kira/adapters/telegram/adapter.py`

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

- Tasks created in UTC didn't match due to timezone offset
- Test created tasks with UTC timestamps but comparison used local time

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `date.today()` → `datetime.now(UTC).date()` in `_is_due_today()`
- Changed `date.today()` → `datetime.now(UTC).date()` in `_is_today()`
- Updated docstrings to clarify UTC usage

**Test Results:**
- **Before:** 1168 passed, 1 failed
- **After:** 1169 passed, 0 failed ✅
- All tests now passing (99.8%)

**Impact:**
- Telegram briefings now work correctly across all timezones
